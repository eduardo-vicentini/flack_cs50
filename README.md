# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

## Idea

This project is done to consolidate the knowledge about javaScript.

To do this, an amount of things is done in the client-side that makes the
application insecure. 
However, with this we can train the changes on the web without the reload of
the web page, bringing a really dynamic page.
